# MoE Transformer Implementation

This project implements a Transformer model with Mixture of Experts (MoE) improvements. The goal is to enhance the model's performance and efficiency using MoE techniques.

## Key Improvements
- Sparse activation of experts for computational efficiency
- Dynamic routing of tokens to specialized experts
- Load balancing across experts for optimal resource utilization

## Structure
- `model.py` - Core MoE Transformer architecture
- `moe_layer.py` - Mixture of Experts layer implementation
- `router.py` - Token routing mechanism
- `train.py` - Training script
- `config.py` - Configuration parameters
